  "task": "Design a single, ultra-high-definition infographic image illustrating the evolution of Artificial Intelligence from 1900 to November 2025. All key event labels and dates must be clearly visible and legible to a common viewer without needing to zoom excessively.",
  
  "concept": {
    "title": "The Ascent of Minds: A Visual History of AI",
    "metaphor": "A dynamic, upward-flowing 'evolutionary tree' or 'digital vine' that grows from a foundational root (early theory) into a dense, multi-branched canopy (modern AI). Each branch represents a core AI domain, and luminous 'fruits' or 'blossoms' on these branches are major milestones.",
    "core_visual_dynamic": "The base (left-bottom) begins with a single, abstract 'seed' or 'root' of theoretical computing. As it ascends diagonally upwards and to the right, it develops into a robust trunk. Around the 1950s, the first major branches (Logic/Expert Systems, NLP, Computer Vision) emerge. These branches thicken, intertwine, and grow more complex. Key events are represented by distinctly glowing, labeled nodes/fruits on their respective branches. The top-right (2025) explodes into a vibrant, interconnected 'canopy' with multiple glowing generative AI entities, symbolizing the current multimodal explosion. The overall flow should feel organic yet precisely structured."

      "readability_priority": "Absolute maximum readability. Text should be large enough, with sufficient padding and contrast. Use a clean, bold, sans-serif font (e.g., 'Montserrat Bold', 'Oswald', 'Lato Heavy').",
      "placement": "Each milestone 'fruit' or 'blossom' node will have its year and brief event description clearly labeled *adjacent* to it. Avoid overlapping text or placing text directly on complex backgrounds without a translucent backing or strong glow. Dates should be prominent.",
      "font_size_guidance": "Dynamic sizing, larger for more recent, impactful events, but all should be legible at a glance. Target a minimum effective font size equivalent to 14pt (web standard) even when viewed as a whole."
