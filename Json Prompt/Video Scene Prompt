  "task": "Generate a single, continuous, ultra-high-definition cinematic video scene (optimized for Google Veo) illustrating the evolution of AI from 1900 to November 2025. The scene will be a 'one-shot' camera fly-through of a dynamically growing 3D structure, evolving from a simple seed of light into a vast, complex canopy of interconnected energy. All text should be minimalist, cinematic, and integrated as on-screen graphics (OSG).",

  "concept": {
    "title": "AI Evolved: A Veo Cinematic",
    "metaphor": "A time-lapse procedural growth of a 'digital tree' or 'crystalline structure' in a 3D data void. It grows from a single, foundational 'seed of light' (early theory) into a dense, multi-branched 'canopy' (modern AI). Milestones are not just labels, but *events* that cause the structure to grow, branch, or change in real-time.",
    "core_visual_dynamic": "A continuous camera move (dolly/crane/fly-through) follows the 'tip' of the growth. It starts on a single, glowing 'seed' (1900s). As the camera moves forward and upward, the seed sprouts, growing into a complex, crystalline 'tree' of light. Major milestones are visual *events* on this structure (e.He., a node flashing, a branch splitting, a burst of particles). The camera's single, uninterrupted path *is* the timeline. The scene culminates in an explosive, interconnected 'canopy' representing the 2025 generative AI boom."
